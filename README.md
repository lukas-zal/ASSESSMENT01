### Quizz assessment attempt
What was made:

-Made the initial menu with the register/login/play/exit options

-Made the quizz game 

-Made the game read questions from API(there is no selection of category)

-Made the quizz score counter per game (there is code for quizz score history and statistics but wasnt correctly added to work with the rest of the program)
